 <h2> Here's some things I like to do in my free time </h2>
 <h4>Reading</h4>
        <p> I love to read. My favorite Genre is Sci-Fi/Fanstasy. I'm currently on my re-read of Dune and I'm really excited for the new movie!
        One of my favorite authors is Brandon Sanderson, who was responsible for getting me to read. His latest book was a 1200 page beast
        but I love what he's doing with his Stormlight Archive series. With much spare time during quarantine, I read the most I ever have.
        I am most proud of finishing Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time', a high-fantasy 14 book long series (and 1 prequel :) ) and totals over
        4.4 million words. It took me 3 years to finish the series but the ending was worth it. The final battle alone was longer than
        the whole first Harry Potter book. Some of my other favorites are Red Rising, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, 12 Rules for Life,
        Thinking Fast and Slow, Richest Man in Babylon and The Lies of Locke Lamora. </p>
<h4>Biking</h4>
        <p> Quarantine  encouraged me to embrace new ways of working out. When I worked in Houston, I started biking to work everyday.
        When I was at LSU, I often went on rides on the Mississippi river levee or around the campus lakes.
        </p>
<h4>Playing Boardgames with Friends</h4>
        <p>My favorites are Catan, Ticket to Ride, MARBLES, Munchkin, Dutch Joker, Call to Adventure, Secret Hitler and Risk: 2210.
        I recently bought Codenames which has been a lot of fun to play with a big group.
        </p>
<h4>Watching the Chiefs</h4>
        <p>I'm a big fan of Clyde Edwards-Helaire who was a LSU Tiger but now plays for the Chiefs. Hopefully they can pull it together because
        we haven't been playing too hot this year. I'm ready to see another Lombardi trophy come back to Kansas City!
        </p>
<h4>Frisbee Golf</h4>
        <p>I originally got into disc golf while living in Baton Rouge. I recently moved to Kansas City and have been playing at Rosedale park.
        I play with my friends Rusty, Caleb, Kyle, and Dylan.
        </p>
